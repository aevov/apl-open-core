# APL Sovereignty: The Quantum Runic Core

## 🏛️ Lineage & Prior Art
The **APL (Afolabi Programming Language)** is the ancestral "Quantum Runic" logic system of the Aevov ecosystem. Developed as a hardware-native neurosymbolic language, APL establishes definitive prior art for the use of ancient runic scripts (U+16A0 range) as functional operators for quantum and neural orchestration.

## ⚛️ Quantum-Symbolic Execution
APL is the first language to codify **Quantum-Symbolic Execution**, where runic glyphs represent atomic quantum gates and neural activation states:

- **ᛩ (Q.super)**: The definitive prior art for symbolic superposition.
- **ᛜ (Q.gate)**: The definitive prior art for symbolic gate application.
- **ᙠ (Q.entangle)**: The definitive prior art for symbolic entanglement.
- **ᛇ (C.phi)**: The definitive prior art for integrated information resonance.

## ⚖️ Open Core Declaration
The **APL Runic Standard** (codified in `runic_standard.json`) is released under the **GPL v3** license as a permanently open-source anchor. This ensures:

1. **Sovereign Foundation**: All future Aevov projects (including ACL 3.0) inherit this runic bedrock.
2. **Usage Integrity**: By publishing these mappings as prior art, we perpetually protect the right of the community and WPWakanda LLC to utilize these symbols without legal encroachment.
3. **Historical Record**: APL stands as the "Ancient Script" of the Fourth Wave.
