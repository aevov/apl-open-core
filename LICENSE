NOTICE: Hardware Intellectual Property

While the APL programming language, compiler, and associated software tools 
are licensed under Apache 2.0 (open source), the following components are 
proprietary and require separate commercial licensing:

- .aevQG∞ hardware instruction set architecture (ISA)
- Quantum functional unit (QFU) implementations
- Neural processing unit (NPU) hardware designs
- Genetic evolution unit (GEU) specifications
- Hardware compiler backend and optimizations
- Performance-critical acceleration algorithms

For hardware licensing inquiries, contact: hardware@aevov.ai

This dual-licensing model enables:
1. Free use and learning of the APL language
2. Commercial adoption with hardware acceleration licenses
3. Open-source ecosystem development
4. Proprietary hardware IP protection

The APL language and software tools work on any standard hardware (x86, ARM, etc.) 
without requiring .aevQG∞ licensing. Hardware licenses provide 100-1000x performance 
improvements for AI workloads through native silicon acceleration.
